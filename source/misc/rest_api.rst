REST
====

.. note::

    These features are only available in :ref:`oTree 2.6 <v26>`,
    currently in beta.

oTree has a small REST API that enables external programs
(such as other websites) to communicate with oTree, in particular:

-   Create sessions
-   Add participant vars

Simply make an JSON-encoded request to one of the below endpoint URLs.
The examples on this page use the Python Requests library (``pip3 install requests``),
but you can make HTTP requests using any programming language,
even JavaScript code in an oTree template.
Additionally, many online tools allow making POST requests (e.g. through webhooks).

If your site is password protected, see the note about authentication below.

"Create sessions" REST endpoint
-------------------------------

POST URL: ``/api/v1/sessions/``

Here are some examples of how the "create sessions" endpoint can be used:

-   Other websites can create oTree sessions automatically
-   You can make a fancier alternative to oTree's :ref:`edit_config` interface
    (e.g. with sliders and visual widgets)
-   Process that will create new oTree sessions on some fixed schedule
-   Command line script to create customized sessions
    (if ``otree create_session`` is not sufficient)

Example
~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: python

    import requests

    def create_session(**payload):
        return requests.post(SERVER_URL + '/api/v1/sessions/', json=payload)

    resp = create_session(session_config_name='trust', room_name='econ101', num_participants=4, modified_session_config_fields=dict(num_apples=10, abc=[1, 2, 3]))
    print(resp.text) # returns the session code

Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~

-   ``session_config_name`` (required)
-   ``num_participants`` (required)
-   ``modified_session_config_fields``: an optional dict of session config parameters,
    as discussed in :ref:`edit_config`.
-   ``room_name`` if you want to create the session in a room.


.. _participant_vars_rest:

"Participant vars" REST endpoint
--------------------------------

POST URL: ``/api/v1/participant_vars/``

This endpoint lets you set a participant's vars, i.e. ``self.participant.vars``.
The main purpose is to allow other sites/apps to pass information about a participant to oTree.
For example, if the user does a survey on Qualtrics that then links to oTree,
you can pass their survey data (like gender, age, etc) into oTree as participant vars.
(Qualtrics allows making POST requests through their `web service <https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/survey-module/survey-flow/advanced-elements/web-service/>`__
feature.)

The POST request would typically be made server-side.
You can do it on the last page of your survey, presumably before you display them their oTree link.

Example
~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: python

    import requests

    def set_participant_vars(**payload):
        return requests.post(SERVER_URL + '/api/v1/participant_vars/', json=payload)

    resp = set_participant_vars(room_name='qualtrics_study', participant_label='albert_e', vars=dict(age=25, is_male=True, x=[3,6,9]))
    print(resp.content)
    resp.raise_for_status() # ensure it succeeded

Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~

-   ``room_name`` (required)
-   ``participant_label`` (required)
-   ``vars`` (required): a dict of participant vars to add. Values can be any JSON-serializable data type,
    even nested dicts/lists.

This feature requires you to use a Room.
Participants are uniquely identified with the combination of room name & participant label.
So you will need to give participants a link with a ``participant_label``,
although this does not need to come from a ``participant_label_file``.

Authentication
--------------

If you have set your auth level to DEMO or STUDY,
you must authenticate your REST API requests.

Create an environment variable (i.e. Heroku config var) ``OTREE_REST_KEY``
on the server. Set it to some secret value.

When you make a request, add that key as an HTTP header called ``otree-rest-key``.
For example:

.. code-block:: python

    import requests

    REST_KEY = 'your_key'

    def create_session(**payload):
        return requests.post(SERVER_URL + '/api/v1/sessions/', json=payload,
            headers={'otree-rest-key': REST_KEY}
        )



Demo & testing
--------------

For convenience during development, you can generate fake vars to simulate
data that, in a real session, will come from the REST API.

In your session config, add the parameter ``mock_exogenous_data=True``
(We call it **exogenous** data because it originates outside oTree.)

Then define a function with the same name (``mock_exogenous_data``)
in your project's shared_in.py (if you are using a text editor,
you may need to create that file).

Here's an example:

.. code-block:: python

    def mock_exogenous_data(session):
        participants = session.get_participants()
        for pp in participants:
            pp.vars.update(age=20, is_male=True) # or make it random

You can also set participant labels here.

When you run a session in demo mode, or using bots, ``mock_exogenous_data()``
will automatically be run after ``creating_session``. However, it will not be run
if the session is created in a room.

If you have multiple session configs that require different exogenous data,
you can branch like this:

.. code-block:: python

    def mock_exogenous_data(session):
        if session.config['name'] == 'whatever':
            ...
        if 'xyz' in session.config['app_sequence']:
            ...
